Building RPM Binary Packages
============================
This section is intended to make it easier for those people that wish to
build RPMs from the source included in this package, but aren't sure how.

1) Copy dfu-programmer-<version>.tar.gz to your RPM SOURCES directory. Usually
   this is /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/.

2) Extract or copy dfu-programmer.spec into your RPM SPECS directory. Usually
   this is /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/.

3) In your RPM SPECS directory, issue the command 'rpm -ba dfu-programmer.spec'.
   This will cause rpm to extract the dfu-programmer sources to a temporary
   directory, build them, and build rpm packages based on the information in
   the spec file. The binary rpms will be put into your RPM RPMS directory.
   Usually this is /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<platform>/.

If you have any further questions, please refer to the RPM documentation.
